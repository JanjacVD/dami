But a combination of supply chain constraints, the global chip shortage, higher-than-average prices, and low inventory at dealerships will conspire to keep EVs out of reach for most people.\n\nInterest in switching from gas to electric is at an all-time high. Car shopping site Edmunds reports the number of people searching for hybrid or electric vehicles jumped 39 percent from February to March and 18 percent over the last few weeks of April 2022.\n\nIt’s difficult to gauge whether immediate demand for EVs is up as a result of the increased gas prices over the past month, but some initial numbers suggest that may be the case.\n\nElectric cars could be hard to find in the short term. Like basically anything moderately expensive and complicated to make that you might want to buy these days, from furniture to electronics, EVs are suffering the same general supply chain and labor shortages affecting so many industries.\n\n## Battery metal prices\n\nThere’s another big EV-specific roadblock that could be made even more complicated by the conflict in Ukraine: the precious metals and other raw materials that go into batteries of electric vehicles. Elements like lithium, cobalt, and nickel are all key to producing the technology that makes electric vehicles go. These were already facing big supply crunches before, thanks to the clean energy revolution: Demand for lithium alone is projected to grow 70 times by 2040.\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine are important suppliers or dealers of many of these elements. While Russia’s actual nickel deposits are small, one of the world’s largest producers of nickel is a Russian company, which has not yet faced sanctions. Still, the idea of this company being cut off from the global market was enough to send buyers into a frenzy, and global nickel prices doubled in one day earlier this month. Just before the war, Ukraine began holding auctions to develop its reserves of lithium, cobalt, copper, and nickel.\n\n“Raw materials are going to be an issue for years to come,” Markus Duesmann, CEO of Audi, told the New York Times newspaper. Automakers and experts say that the escalating tensions in Ukraine could accelerate the development of metals elsewhere as demand for electric cars increases. But since it takes time to develop new sources of these important commodities—which also have their own serious environmental and justice issues—the industry is looking at a long, possibly painful adjustment period.","title":"EVs (unfortunately) won’t save us from high fuel prices","content_creator":{"id":1,"content_creator":"Team AiLend","published_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.385Z","created_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:05.420Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.400Z"},"description":"If you’re tired of skyrocketing fuel prices and are thinking about the benefits of an electric ride, chances are you’re not alone.

But the company says it's actually a real device you'll be able to buy sometime this fall. \n\nAn announcement from some days ago is just an initial reveal of the Zone headphones ahead of a release date, and Dyson isn’t announcing yet specific details like price or specifications (including how much the headphones weigh or how long the battery will last) at this time. But, it seems safe to assume that these will cost more than your typical premium noise-canceling headphones from Bose and Sony, and maybe even more than Apple's AirPods Max headphones.\n\n## How the air-purifier works\n\nThe air purification half of the Zone doesn’t reinvent the wheel for Dyson, a company that's best known for its high-end vacuum cleaners.  Instead, it miniaturizes the company’s existing air filtration technology into a unique form factor. \"The compressors in each ear cup draw air through the dual-layer filters and project two streams of purified air to the wearer's nose and mouth, channeled through the non-contact visor,\" Dyson explains. \"Sculpted returns on the visor ensure purified airflow is kept near to the nose and mouth and diluted as little as possible by external crosswinds.\"\n\nAccording to Dyson, the air-filtration component is a \"non-contact\" system, which means it doesn't touch your face like a mask but rather sits just in front of it. \n\n## The audio side\n\nOn the audio side, Dyson says you can expect a premium listening experience with an accurate, neutral audiophile sound profile and proprietary advanced noise canceling. The headphones are also designed with comfort in mind. Each ear cup houses two motors, and Dyson says they're the smallest in any of its machines to date. The headphones connect via Bluetooth -- no word on what version number -- and can also be used to make voice calls.\n\n## The Zone’s key features\n\nAccording to Dyson, the Zone will have the following:\n\n-\tRadical new format for delivering purified air and high-fidelity audio on-the-go\n-\tElectrostatic filtration captures 99% of particle pollution as small as 0.1 micron, such as dust, pollen and bacteria\n-\tContact-free air delivery visor channels two streams of purified air to the nose and mouth, engineered specifically for usage outdoors and in crosswinds\n-\tAdvanced ANC (active noise canceling) and a high performing neodymium electroacoustic system deliver rich, immersive audio that faithfully replicates audio as the artist or creator intended\n-\tIsolation mode: Highest level of active noise cancellation\n-\tConversation mode: Activates when you dip the visor –- automatically turns off the purification to conserve battery power and amplifies the conversation\n","title":"It’s not Sci-Fi, Dyson’s new headphones have a built-in air purifier","content_creator":{"id":1,"content_creator":"Team AiLend","published_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.385Z","created_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:05.420Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.400Z"},"description":"Dyson's new Zone air-purifying headphones look like something you'd expect to see in a sci-fi movie.

The distributed nature of blockchain technology is what makes the Ethereum platform secure, and that security enables ETH to accrue value.\n\n### A brief history of Ethereum\n\n**Vitalik Buterin**, who is credited with conceiving the original Ethereum concept, published a white paper to introduce Ethereum in 2013. The Ethereum platform was launched in 2015 by Buterin and **Joe Lubin**, founder of the blockchain software company ConsenSys. The founders of Ethereum were among the first to consider the full potential of blockchain technology, beyond just enabling the secure trading of virtual currency.\n\nOne notable event in Ethereum’s history is the hard fork, or split, of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. In 2016, a group of network participants gained majority control of the Ethereum blockchain to steal more than $50 million worth of ether, which had been raised for a project called The DAO. \n\nThe success of the raid was attributed to involvement by a third-party developer for the new project. While the majority of the Ethereum community opted to reverse the theft by invalidating the existing Ethereum blockchain and approving a blockchain with a revised history, a fraction of the community chose to maintain the original version of the Ethereum blockchain. That unaltered version of Ethereum permanently split to become the cryptocurrency Ethereum Classic, or ETC.\n\nSince the launch of Ethereum, ether as a cryptocurrency has risen to become the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. In 2022 it is outranked only by Bitcoin.\n\n### How does Ethereum work?\n\nEthereum, like other cryptocurrencies, uses blockchain technology. Imagine a very long chain of blocks linked together, with all of the information about each block known to every member of the blockchain network. With every member of the network having the same knowledge of the blockchain, which functions as an electronic ledger, distributed consensus can be created and maintained about the status of the blockchain.\n\nBlockchain technology creates distributed consensus about the state of the Ethereum network. New blocks are added to the very long Ethereum blockchain to process Ethereum transactions and mint new ether coins or to execute smart contracts for Ethereum dApps (Decentralized Applications).\n\nA vast network of computers worldwide maintains the Ethereum blockchain network, and the network requires distributed consensus—majority agreement—for any changes to be made to the blockchain. An individual or group of network participants would need to gain majority control of the Ethereum platform’s computing power—a task that would be gargantuan, if not impossible—to successfully manipulate the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Ethereum platform can support many more applications than ETH and other cryptocurrencies. The network’s users can create, publish, monetize, and use a diverse range of applications on the Ethereum platform, and can use ETH or another cryptocurrency as payment.\n\n### How can I buy Ethereum?\n\nInvestors can use one of many cryptocurrency exchange platforms to buy and sell ether. Ethereum is supported by dedicated crypto exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, and Binance, and by brokerages like Robinhood.\n\n### How does Ethereum make money?\n\nEthereum is not a centralized organization that makes money. Miners and validators who participate in operating the Ethereum network, usually by mining, earn ETH rewards for their contributions.\n\n### Ethereum vs. Bitcoin\n\nEthereum is often compared to Bitcoin. While the two cryptocurrencies have many similarities, potential investors should pay attention to some important distinctions.\n\nEthereum is described as “the world’s programmable blockchain,” positioning itself as an electronic, programmable network with many applications. The Bitcoin blockchain, by contrast, was created only to support the bitcoin cryptocurrency.\n\nEthereum isn't just for digital money. Anything you can own can be represented, traded and put to use as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You can tokenize your art and get royalties automatically every time it's re-sold. Or use a token for something you own to take out a loan. The possibilities are growing all the time.","title":"Ethereum, explained.

It provides accounts featuring currency exchange, debit cards, virtual cards, Apple Pay, interest-bearing \"vaults\", commission-free stock trading, crypto, commodities, and other services.\n\n### What is exactly?\n\nRevolut proffers a range of digital banking services in a mobile app targeted at young tech-savvy users, including:\n\n- Transferring money abroad in 29 currencies (in 2022)\n- A pre-paid debit card that enables cash machine withdrawals in 120 countries (in 2022)\n- A cryptocurrency exchange allowing users to convert currencies into Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash or XRP\n- Vaults for budgeting and saving money\n- Mobile phone and overseas medical insurance\n\n### Who founded Revolut?\n\nRevolut was founded by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko. Mr. Storonsky is Russian-born, but carries a British passport and has lived in the UK since the age of 20. Mr. Yatsenko is Ukranian-British and has lived in the UK since 2010. \n\nMr. Yatsenko and Mr. Storonsky created start-up Revolut and launched it in July 2015 at the Level39 tech accelerator in Canary Wharf.\n\nMr. Yatsenko serves as Revolut's chief technology officer, while Mr. Storonsky is the chief executive of the firm in 2022.\n\n### How big is Revolut?\n\nRevolut has expanded into new markets such as Japan and expanded staff from 1500 to around 5000 in 2021. In November 2020 it was breaking even and, with a £4.2 billion valuation became the UK's most valuable fintech. In January 2021 it applied for a UK banking license. \n\nAn $800 million funding round in July 2021 brought the value of the company to $33 billion, making it also the most valuable UK tech startup at the time.\n\n### How to open a Revolut personal account\n\nOpening a Revolut personal account is simple:\n\n- You just download the app and put in your phone number\n- Then you will set a password and a 6 digit code will be sent to your phone to verify the account\n- It will ask you for your name, birth date, address, and email\n- Then you will make an initial deposit by putting in your bank details for a transfer to be initiated\n- Then you will need to provide a selfie and a picture of your passport for verification\n- You’ll be asked to select either a standard, premium, or metal account, and pay the fee (standard is free)\n\n## A word of caution\n\nRevolut holds multiple banking licenses. However, **it is not yet a full bank**.\n\nWhile Revolut holds banking licenses in 10 different countries in 2022, the accounts live in the UK, and therefore for all intents and purposes, Revolut should not be seen as a bank.\n\nHowever, Revolut says on its website:\n\n> Funds with Revolut remain safeguarded in accounts with a tier-one UK bank, as per our obligations under the e-money regulations. Plus, all of your card transactions are processed by the Mastercard or Visa network and are protected by Mastercard or Visa rules.\n\nRemember that Revolut will only communicate with you through their online chat feature and through their call automated phone line.

When you are stressed, you are more likely to get irritated faster or cause unnecessary debates. Productivity also drops exponentially, slowing you down and causing - unfortunately - even more stress. It may take some time at first, but it is absolutely important to break the cycle and calm down.\n\nWe at AiLend prioritize the well-being and care of colleagues, so from time to time, we take care that we are on the ground and share tips with each other on how to live and work healthier. Below are some of our favorite techniques we use to calm down and relax. We hope you find them useful :)\n\n## Focus on your accomplishments 🔓\n\nThink of a moment when you did something very difficult and yet you still succeeded. That feeling of \"I've faced harder things than that and I made it\" can be extremely powerful. In addition, it allows you to take a step back for a second and understand the perspective, which we rarely do. If that doesn't work, put in a smile. Studies show that smiling makes it easier to cope with a stressful situation.\n\n## Read a book 📖\n\nWhen the temperature of the situation gets too hot, we all want to escape. The book is a perfect way to get rid of the “heat”. There is no need for an internet connection, which allows you to disconnect from the phone, emails, social media, which are great conductors for stressful situations. Stories that have nothing to do with your work or life allow you to give your brain a little rest and anxiety, and also make you feel better about the way you are spending your time.\n\n## Meditate 🧘\n\nHave no idea where to start? There are endless online resources or free mobile apps that guide you through the whole experience. By meditating for a few minutes every day, studies show that not only the mind but also the body is relaxed which enables the removal of stress. Will you be stressed again? Of course. But, at least, the stress intensity decreases and lasts less time.\n\n## Make a step back 🚶🏽‍♀️\n\nThe first moment you feel stress overwhelm you, focus on breathing - usually at such moments breathing is fast and shallow. By taking a deep breath, you will immediately understand the difference. If you can, you can take a short break to distance yourself from the situation. You can use the vacation to take a short walk, dance, enjoy a favorite food or meet someone close. Oftentimes, just taking a step back helps us to see things from a different perspective. When you stop controlling something (or someone), things go their way.\n\n## Organize your day 📅\n\nOne of the biggest sources of stress is being late. To avoid this source of anxiety, make sure you give yourself time from one appointment to another by organizing the calendar well. This can be applied to work, as well as other situations - such as travel. Creating free spaces during the day so that you do not have meetings one after the other, helps to reduce the anxiety that comes when you need to change the topic of discussion, meeting place or the way of contact immediately.","title":"5 easy ways to calm down in stressful periods","content_creator":{"id":1,"content_creator":"Team AiLend","published_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.385Z","created_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:05.420Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.400Z"},"description":"We at AiLend prioritize the well-being and care of colleagues, so from time to time, we take care that we are on the ground and share tips with each other on how to live and work healthier.","slug":"5-easy-ways-to-calm-down-in-stressful-periods","image":{"id":5,"name":"photo-1453227588063-bb302b62f50b.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":870,"height":580,"formats":{"small":{"ext":".jpg","url":"/uploads/small_photo_1453227588063_bb302b62f50b_431173b049.jpg","hash":"small_photo_1453227588063_bb302b62f50b_431173b049","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"small_photo-1453227588063-bb302b62f50b.jpg","path":null,"size":17.82,"width":500,"height":333},"medium":{"ext":".jpg","url":"/uploads/medium_photo_1453227588063_bb302b62f50b_431173b049.jpg","hash":"medium_photo_1453227588063_bb302b62f50b_431173b049","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"medium_photo-1453227588063-bb302b62f50b.jpg","path":null,"size":32.92,"width":750,"height":500},"thumbnail":{"ext":".jpg","url":"/uploads/thumbnail_photo_1453227588063_bb302b62f50b_431173b049.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_photo_1453227588063_bb302b62f50b_431173b049","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"thumbnail_photo-1453227588063-bb302b62f50b.jpg","path":null,"size":6.03,"width":234,"height":156}},"hash":"photo_1453227588063_bb302b62f50b_431173b049","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":40.57,"url":"/uploads/photo_1453227588063_bb302b62f50b_431173b049.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2022-03-03T17:20:54.873Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T17:20:54.891Z"},"tags":[{"id":5,"hashtag":"life","published_at":"2022-03-03T17:23:29.548Z","created_at":"2022-03-03T17:23:24.691Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T17:23:29.576Z"}]},{"id":15,"prod":null,"published_at":"2022-05-30T18:55:58.155Z","created_at":"2022-05-10T09:22:24.946Z","updated_at":"2022-05-30T18:55:58.178Z","content":"People of AILend is our newest rubric to get to know our team members better.\n\nFor the first interview, we chose Nensi, one of our Full-Stack developers, in charge of platform design, development, and maintenance. Beyond that, she is the “conscience” of the company (she always has something to say for each of us) since January 2021 when she joined us and has the “task” of preparing group games whenever we get together.\n\nFrom the questions below we will try to get a clearer idea of Nensi.\n\n### How do you prefer to start the day?\nMy day starts around 7:30. I get ready, eat breakfast, put on my headphones, and press play on Spotify. My favorite part is when I pick up the bike and cross the road from home to the office. As I pass along the cars and people who also have just started the day, possibly with Marshall Hain's “Dancing in the city” song in the background, when I arrive I feel filled with positive energy. I greet the group, have a coffee on the office balcony, and then we all get together at 9 am for the next daily meeting.\n\n### What motivates you at work?\nI never thought of work as something I had to find the specific motivation to get it done. I call it part of my lifestyle and everything comes naturally. I think the environment created in the office certainly influences me to see it that way. Of course, the responsibility and deadline that comes with every job I take on often also stimulate the productivity of the day. There are definitely days when the only thing I can do is listen to music or read the New Yorker. However, what fulfills me the most is when we stop from time to time, appreciate what we have all achieved as a group, how much each of us has grown both technically and personally, and how much there is still work to be done.\n\n### What was one thing you wanted to know when you started working at AILend and what advice would you give to a beginner?\n“It's okay to think I do not know enough for how long you will learn.” At least in the world of programming and technology, I think there is a bombardment of successful models, especially at a very young age. As motivating as it is, it can also be intimidating. Luckily, my first job in this profession was at AILend and I felt welcome to perform as far as I know, without the pressure to catapult myself into a “senior” overnight. I remember the first interview with Arsidi, in which I said “Look, I have no previous experience, but I think I can learn”, something I understand that I still did not believe myself. Even though I successfully completed the interview task and got the job, I still had some way to convince myself that I could do it in this world. How did I do it? With a lot of support from the whole group, asking as many questions and above all realizing that things are simpler than they seem, enough to get them started.\n\n### There will always be unexpected changes that need to happen in a project. How do you cope with these surprises?\nI will call this one of those types of skills that will always be “work-in-progress”. With each new challenge that comes up in different projects, I learn something and realize that the effectiveness of submitting a job always has room for improvement. Of course, there are certainly two paths when it comes to surprises that may arise along the way. First I will try to solve it myself. If it's something completely new, I'll do my research. If there is no time for this, then I will turn to the team, with the possibility that someone has encountered something similar. It is important to measure yourself in each project, to master what I did not know, and in the meantime not to lose the way to achieve the main goal.\n\n### How do you like to spend time outside of work?\nI am a social person and I enjoy time in the presence of my closest people. I try to go out of Tirana when I can and do something different on the weekends. Other times I prefer to spend it alone, by bike, listening to audiobooks, or outdoors without any interference from the outside world.\n","title":"People of AILend: Nensi Ahmetbeja","content_creator":{"id":1,"content_creator":"Team AiLend","published_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.385Z","created_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:05.420Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.400Z"},"description":"People of AILend is our newest rubric to get to know our team members better.

After all, there are so many steps, tasks, and requirements, and you may be anxious about making an expensive mistake. But first-time homebuyers enjoy some special advantages created to encourage new entrants into the real estate market.\n\nTo demystify the process, so you get the most out of your purchase, here is a rundown of what you need to consider before you buy and what you can expect from the buying process itself.\n\n## Some questions to consider before you buy 🤔\n\nYour first step is to determine what your long-term goals are and how home ownership fits in with those goals. Perhaps you’re simply looking to transform all those “wasted” rent payments into mortgage payments that give you something tangible: equity. Or maybe you see homeownership as a sign of independence and enjoy the idea of being your own landlord. Also, buying a home can be a good investment. Here are six questions to consider:\n\n### 1. How’s your financial health?\n\nBuying a house may be the biggest financial decision you'll ever make, so before you take the plunge you want to be sure your finances are solid.\n\nUsing a home affordability calculator (we have one in AiLend) can help you determine your budget by taking into account your income, debts, location, and down payment amount (more on down payments in a moment). You'll be able to see how your monthly mortgage payments might add up and how your finances could look like a homeowner's.\n\nThis can be important for keeping your ambitions down to earth. You might be able to qualify for a sizable mortgage, but that doesn't mean you want to commit that much of your budget to housing.\n\n### 2. What's my plan for the down payment?\n\nWhen you've determined what you can afford, you can figure out how much you want to save for a down payment. Though 20% down payments used to be the norm, many homeowners opt to put down less. A smaller down payment requires less money upfront but means you'll have to pay mortgage insurance and more money afterward.\n\n### 3. What is there on my wishlist?\n\nThere'd be some fun steps! And coming up with a list of must-haves and nice-to-haves for your house is one of them. Whether you’re looking for a starter home or somewhere you can imagine living for years to come, there are lots of little details.\n\n### 4. How can I get approved for a mortgage?\n\nBefore you start buying, it is important to have an idea of what a lender should do to buy the first home. You may think you can afford a home of a required value, but you have to rely on what such as how much other debt you have, your monthly income, and how much time you have in your current job. Moreover, many real estate agents will not spend time with what they can not explain that they can afford to spend.\n\n### 5. How much home can you afford?\n\nSometimes a bank will give you a loan for more house than you want to pay for. Just because a bank says it will lend you an amount doesn’t mean that you should borrow that much. Many first-time homebuyers make this mistake and end up “house-poor” with little left after they make their monthly mortgage payment to cover other costs, such as clothing, utilities, vacations, entertainment, or even food.\n\nIn deciding how big a loan to take, you’ll want to look at the house’s total cost, not just the monthly payment. We at AiLend can also help with this: our task is to refer and make the lending process as easy as possible so that the client needs to go to the bank branch.\n\nConsider how high the property taxes are in your chosen neighborhood, how much homeowners insurance will cost, how much you anticipate spending to maintain or improve the house, and how much your closing costs will be. House shopping with a smaller budget than you are approved for will not only make your financial life more flexible but can also help you in today's hot housing market.\n\n### 6. Who will guide you through the homebuying process?\n\nA real estate agent will help you locate homes that meet your needs and are in your price range:  we at AiLend for this have a special calculator to help with this. Once you’ve chosen a home to buy, these professionals can assist you in negotiating the entire purchase process, including making an offer, getting a loan, and completing paperwork. A good real estate agent’s expertise can protect you from any pitfalls that you might encounter during the process. Most agents receive a commission, paid from the seller’s proceeds.\n\n### 7. Why do I need to purchase homeowners insurance?\n\nIt might feel a little strange to take out an insurance policy on a home you don't own yet, but most lenders make securing homeowners insurance a condition of giving you a mortgage. You'll want enough coverage to fully replace the home (which might not be the same as your purchase price or the appraised value), and typically the policy should become effective on your closing date.","title":"First time buying a house?

People worry about it, think of ways to get more of it, and dream about how to spend it. But how much do we really know about money?\n\nFirst of all, regardless of its size, money doesn't always have value. The total global worth, currently estimated to be around $420 trillion, depends on the importance that people place on it as a medium of exchange and as a unit of measurement.\n\nMoney allows people to trade goods and services indirectly; it helps communicate the price of goods, and it provides individuals with a way to store their wealth.\n\n## Bartering\n\nMoney—in some form or another—has been part of human history for at least the past 5,000 years. Before that time, historians generally agree that a system of bartering was likely used.\n\nBartering is a direct trade of goods and services; for example, a farmer may exchange a bushel of wheat for a pair of shoes from a shoemaker.\n\nOver the centuries easily traded items like animal skins, salt, and weapons were used as currencies, even though the value of each of these items was still negotiable in many cases. This system of trading spread across the world and still survives today in some parts of the globe.\n\n## Seashells\n\nSome of the earliest currencies were objects from nature: humans used seashells, animal teeth, and livestock as tokens for barter for thousands of years.\n\nA notable example is cowrie shells, first used as money about 1200 BC. They had a number of advantages: they were similar in size, small, and durable. While the mollusks that produce the shells are found on the coasts of the Indian and Pacific oceans, even some European countries accepted cowrie shells as currency as a result of the expansion of trade.\n\nAnother currency from nature was whale teeth, which were used by Fijians: eventually, those became a currency and remain part of the island’s culture.\n\n## Coins\n\nCoins were a revolution in simplicity and changed money forever. They eliminated the need to weigh and test the purity of each piece of metal before a transaction. \n\nThey were made with metals that were considered precious, durable, and rare. Gold and silver had been used for thousands of years as money, so having coins made from these metals ensured there would be a natural demand for them.\n\nThe idea of fungible or interchangeable money was another revolutionary step. When two things are fungible, they have equal value and can be interchanged with one another. Coins from the same mint were identical and uniform, making them perfect accounting denominations.\n\n## Leather money\n\nAbout the 6th century BC, leather and animal hide began to be fashioned into currency. Early ancient Rome reportedly used this type of money. It was also found in such areas as Carthage and what is now France, and Russia is believed to have used leather money into Peter the Great’s reign (1682–1725 CE). The Chinese emperor Wudi (reigned 141–87 BC) created currency out of skins from his personal collection of white stags. It was fringed and decorated with elaborate designs. Although no longer used, leather money may have left a lasting legacy.\n\n## Credit cards\n\nCredit has existed for ages, but it was not introduced until 1950: that year, Ralph Schneider and Frank McNamara, two Americans, founded the Diners Club. Other cards were soon created, and in 1959 American Express debuted a plastic card. \n\nIBM introduced the magnetic stripe on credit cards, in the 1960s, to contain account information. This was a big step because merchants no longer needed to make phone calls to obtain authorization from credit companies. \n\nIn the 1990s, cards began to have chips embedded in them to encrypt their information, providing even greater security. Other changes involved account balances. In the beginning, credit card users were required to pay the full balance at the end of the month. Later, American Express allowed consumers to carry balances—though interest was applied—and other credit companies quickly followed. Customers took advantage of this development—maybe a little too much. In 2017 American consumers were carrying $1 trillion in credit card debt.\n\n## Cryptocurrencies\n\nCryptocurrencies are a digital currency system created in 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who initially called his invention Bitcoin. The currency is not issued by a central bank and is not regulated, though a decentralized network of computers keeps track of transactions. \n\nThe value of cryptocurrencies is determined by bidding, similar to the way stocks are valued. The users are anonymous, known only by their digital wallet ID. How are cryptocurrencies created? In a process called mining. This involves a race between computers to solve complex math problems and thus verify blocks of transactions. \n\nWhile that may sound easy, it isn’t. It’s estimated that nearly seven trillion attempts may have to be made before a solution is discovered. In the end, the owner of the winning computer gets newly created cryptos, and the system is made more secure. The cap for the number of Bitcoins that can be created is 21 million, and more than 17 million have been created so far.\n","title":"A brief history of money: transition from bartering to today’s cryptocurrencies","content_creator":{"id":1,"content_creator":"Team AiLend","published_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.385Z","created_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:05.420Z","updated_at":"2022-02-14T10:21:07.400Z"},"description":"Money.

Here are some steps to help you out\")](https://uat.ailend.io/en/blogArticle_en/first-time-buying-a-house-here-are-some-steps-to-help-you-out) we listed some questions to help anyone looking for their first home.\n\nHowever, some tips may be needed by anyone who is not a beginner: although some of the processes may seem easy, there is always room for improvement. After all, we are talking about a big step. And remember: buying is not the end of it.\n\n## The buying process\n\nNow that you’ve decided to take the plunge, let’s explore what you can expect from the home buying process itself.\n\n### Find a home\n\nOnce you’re seriously shopping for a home, don’t walk into an open house without having an agent (or at least being prepared to throw out the name of someone with whom you’re supposedly working). You can see how it might not work in your best interest to start dealing with a seller’s agent before contacting one of your own.\n\n### Preapprovals and choosing lenders\n\nDon’t be bound by loyalty to your current financial institution when seeking a pre-approval or searching for a mortgage: Shop around, even if you only qualify for one type of loan. Fees can be surprisingly varied. We at [AiLend](https://uat.ailend.io/en/home) deal with the simplification of getting a loan: log in to our website [(ailend.io)](https://uat.ailend.io/en/home) and apply in less than 90 seconds to understand your loan options.\n\nOnce you’ve settled on a lender and applied, the lender will verify all of the financial information provided (checking credit scores, verifying employment information, etc.).\n\nThe lender can pre-approve the borrower for a certain amount. Be aware that even if you have been pre-approved for a mortgage, your loan can fall through at the last minute if you do something to alter your credit score, such as finance a car purchase.\n\n### Make an offer\n\nFound a home that's right for you? Now's the time to make an offer. Your real estate agent can be a tremendous resource here, providing you with comparable sales information and any intel about the sellers they might have gleaned from the selling agent (like if they've already found a new place and are extra motivated to sell).\n\n### Have the home inspected\n\nEven if the home that you plan to purchase appears to be flawless, there’s no substitute for having a trained professional do a home inspection of the property for the quality, safety, and overall condition of your potential new home. You don’t want to get stuck with a money pit or with the headache of performing a lot of unexpected repairs. If the home inspection reveals serious defects that the seller did not disclose, then you’ll generally be able to rescind your offer and get your deposit back. Alternatively, you can negotiate to have the seller make the repairs or discount the selling price.\n\n### Close. Or move on\n\nIf you’re able to work out a deal with the seller—or better yet, if the inspection didn’t reveal any significant problems—then you should be ready to close. Closing basically involves signing a ton of paperwork in a very short time period, while praying that nothing falls through at the last minute. In that case, you can move on and look for something else.\n\n## Congratulations, new homeowner! Now what?\n\nYou’ve signed the papers and paid the movers, and the new place is starting to feel like home. Game over, right? Not quite. Homeownership costs extend beyond down payments and monthly mortgage payments. Let’s now go over some final tips to make life as a new homeowner more fun and secure.\n\n### Keep saving\n\nWith homeownership comes major unexpected expenses, such as replacing the roof or getting a new water heater. Start an emergency fund for your home so that you won't be caught off guard when these costs inevitably arise.\n\n### Perform regular maintenance\n\nWith the large amount of money that you’re putting into your home, you’ll want to make sure to take excellent care of it. Regular maintenance can decrease your repair costs by allowing problems to be fixed when they are small and manageable.\n\n### Ignore the housing market\n\nIt doesn’t matter what your home is worth at any given moment except the moment when you sell it. Being able to choose when you sell your home, rather than being forced to sell it due to job relocation or financial distress, will be the biggest determinant of whether you will see a solid profit from your investment.\n","title":"Ready for a new house?
